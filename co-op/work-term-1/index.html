<h2>Work Term 1 - M&T Printing Group</h2>
  <p>My name is Sam Bowman, and this summer was first co-op work term. After a long job search and my most memorable year of school to date, I was hired for the position of Web Specialist at M&T Printing Group
  in Kitchener, where my mother has worked for the past eighteen years. The comfortable and air-conditioned building was a stark contrast from the factory and food service jobs I had done in
  the past, and marked the first opportunity I've had to really show off my skillset in the workplace.</p>
  <p>My first task for M&T was to upload products to the POOL website. POOL stands for <b>P</b>roducts <b>O</b>rdering <b>O</b>n<b>l</b>ine.
  It is a service that allows our customers to order products specially printed for them, such as business cards, envelopes and posters. Some of these products would be ordered with the
  same information printed on them every time. These are called static products. Conversely, dynamic products contain information that the customer may want to
  customize for that particular order - for instance, they may have a generic business card format which contains fields for the name, position and contact information of a particular employee.
  My tasks generally involved entering information for static products. I scanned images and formatted them to be the appropriate size and quality for the website, then uploaded these along with information for the product.
  This included names, codes, weights, and prices among other information. This experience forced me to learn the language of print media, and learn new terms for kinds of paper and ink that the company uses. Picking up
  information became a skill to me, and I believe I can carry that skill with me to new jobs in the future.</p>
  <p>While I was uploading products onto the website, I noticed that the information for the products on their website lacked structure and was often entered in an ad hoc fashion. I wanted to
  standardize the way information was entered, and this became my first learning goal. However this was more difficult than it sounded, and so my next task became the standardization of items already on the
  POOL site for particular customers. This also helped me improve my ability to speak the print media language, as I had to pick information about a product out of its description, verify that it was correct
  and then standardize its presentation on the website.</p>
  <p>Another task I took upon myself was to research eBook format specifications for Volumes, a publishing division of M&T, after one of their employees expressed interest in offering eBooks for
  their customers. I used my time to compare formats based on their popularity and acceptance by major eBook retailers, and eventually prepared a report that I submitted to Volumes during my last week at M&T.</p>
  <p>This was the extent of my summer at M&T. I learned a lot about the printing industry and the world of business, and I gained experience with some of the software used by major corporations.
  I had a wonderful summer, and I look forward to more wonderful opportunities in the future!</p>

<h2>About M&T Printing</h2>
  <p>M&T Printing Group was founded in 1968 by Don Froome - then in the advertising business - in London, Ontario. It has since expanded across southern Ontario from London to Guelph,
  with the largest office being on 907 Frederick Street in Kitchener, where I spent my summer. The company has made a name for itself across North America with their affordable prices
  and lightning fast service - M&T stands for Money & Time, both of which they will save you. Arguably the biggest factor contributing to M&T's success, however, is their willingness
  to go beyond what is expected for their customers, simplifying the amount of effort that is required on a customers part and offering to deliver more than what is expected.</p>
  <p>I draw parallels between this and the Software Design classes I've taken at the university. Truly this is an example of a company that creates a system that works for their customers,
  and creates a positive and beneficial experience for them.</p>
  <p>46 years later, M&T has since expanded to create Volumes, a self-publishing company for authors as well as universities and colleges. M&T was also honored to receive the Business of
  the Year Award at the 2014 Business Excellence Awards Gala earlier this year. Today, Don still works at M&T, though most of the work has since been passed down to his sons. Mike and Dean
  handle the day to day management of M&T, and keep it running strong in as the industry leader that it is today.</p>

  <h2>Learning Goals</h2>
  <p>Because this job wasn't a programming job, I chose to focus mostly on soft skills that could be gleaned from this environment by doing specific tasks.
  In retrospect, some of these worked out better than others. Nonetheless I believe I learned a lot and I look forward to setting and achieving my learning
  goals in future semesters.</p>

  <h3>Goal: Develop a standard for entering items to the POOL website</h3>

  <p>The POOL site was originally designed with very specific products in mind, and had a specific form to be filled in that would contain all of the required
  product information in a uniform fashion. However it became apparent that this form wasn't dynamic enough to suit all of the products being placed
  on the website, so it fell out of use in favor of fields which allowed employees to enter a large text description of the product instead. These descriptions
  were often formatted differently than the descriptions of similar products, leading to inconsistencies across the website.</p>

  <p>My first goal was to develop a standard for products being entered onto the website. Unfortunately, I would later find out that the POOL website serves
  over 300 customers and contains over 10,000 products. I originally wanted to create documentation that would allow employees to maintain formats for specific
  types of products. Unfortunately due to the sheer number and variety of products, as well as the potential that the documents themselves could be filled in
  inconsistently, led me to realize that this wasn't a viable solution to the problem. The ideal solution would be a change to the website, allowing it to be
  dynamic enough (perhaps by allowing employees to create new fields as needed) that it would allow for a larger variety of products. Unfortunately this wasn't
  within my power to do.</p>

  <p>While I was not able to complete this goal, I have still learned from it. I know more about assessing the viability of design solutions, and how to address
  the scope of a design problem. I also realized that the best solutions should not take the form of an additional layer over the problem, but should directly address
  the problem itself. It must also be suitable for the scale of the problem - that is to say, the poor company should not be faced with the prospect of creating
  and maintaining hundreds of documents to document customer preferences! This is knowledge that I will carry with me into my future as I continue my schooling and
  work for new companies.</p>

  <h3>Goal: Make improvements to some of the in-house software and website</h3>

  <p>As mentioned above, there were improvements to be made to the POOL website, and the same could be said for some of the software developed in-house. Some of
  the programs lacked comprehensive user feedback. One struggled to handle large amounts of processing. This struck me as being right up my alley, and something
  I could sink my teeth into with my background of computer programming. Unfortunately this also wasn't meant to be, as I couldn't get access to the source code
  or website code.</p>

  <h3>Goal: Improve my understanding of web and application development, in a real-world setting</h3>

  <p>This goal was a natural tie-in to my other two goals. My hope was that by working with the company's software and website, I would gain some of the experience
  required to be effective in the industry. Unfortunately since neither of those goals worked out, neither did this one. I did however manage to gain a significant
  amount of experience using various types of software, such as Adobe Photoshop, Microsoft Office and Pageflex Studio. Using these tools in a workplace environment
  rather than a personal or academic environment has taught me a great deal about software usability. I saw firsthand which features of these programs worked and which
  needed improvement, and I also heard the opinions of my coworkers when they found flaws in the programs they used. This is knowledge I will be able to use when developing
  my own software in the future.</p>

  <p>Upon reflection, my first learning goal of Fall 2014 will be to create better learning goals. My learning goals for this semester were written hastily as I was
  hired on very late into the summer. This fall, I'll be working at Sandbox Software Solutions. I will have the opportunity to create specific goals and achieve them
  with ample time, and plenty of effort!</p>
