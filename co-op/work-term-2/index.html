title: Work Term 2 - Sandbox Software Solutions
---
<h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>I spent the Fall of 2014 at Sandbox Software Solutions, right here in Guelph, Ontario. This was a semester of many firsts: it was my first semester working for a real software company, a glimpse of what I'll be doing in the future; and it was the first time I'd ever done web development (unless you count my childhood experience with HTML on Neopets - not exactly something I'd put on a resume).</p>

  <h2>Getting Style</h2>
  <p>During my time at Sandbox I was primarily involved in styling the appearance of websites. This predominately involved CSS, along with a small amount of JavaScript. I had to ensure that websites looked attractive when viewed on a variety of devices - a concept referred to in the industry as responsive design. I also had to ensure compatibility with various the browsers used by our clients.</p>

  <h2>Standards</h2>
  <p>The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) set standards for developers to follow when creating documents for web. Part of these standards are the Web Consortium Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), which sets rules a website must follow in order to be accessible to people with disabilities. This may include people with impaired vision (who require a high degree of contrast to be able to easily read text), or people who use screen readers that read what is being displayed on screen. In the case of screen readers, documents must be formatted properly to easily facilitate processing by the screen reader. One simple example of this is that important images should have alternative text (an 'alt' property in HTML) that accurately describes what the image depicts. If the image is a link and the link has no other text to describe its context, then the alt text should provide a brief description of what where the link leads.</p>
  <p>In conjunction with WACG standards, we were also mindful of the Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities act, which also features rules for websites to follow.</p>

  <h2>Sample Project - What I Did</h2>
  <p>One of the projects I worked on - and one that I am the most proud of - was for Paragon Kitchens. The Guelph-based company designs and builds custom kitchens for clients all over southern Ontario.</p>
  <p>This project was one of my first major projects with Sandbox. I took the reins from the previous co-op student, to transform the partially finished website into one which matched the clients' needs. I relied heavily on the Sandbox team - particularly Mark George, my supervisor - to build the website up to the point where it was eventually ready for deployment.</p>
  <p>I was delighted to be allowed to help with training the Sandbox employees on their website once it launched. This was one of the most exciting, enriching, and memorable parts of my co-op experience.</p>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>Sandbox Software Solutions is a fantastic team of people. There is an atmosphere in the office that is unmatched by any other place I've worked. I've come out of this semester with infinitely more knowledge and experience than I had at in the summer. I'd go back in a heartbeat, and I'd recommend any of my friends to work there.</p>
