  In the summer of 2015, I was fortunate enough to work for eSentire in Cambridge, Ontario. eSentire is a cybersecurity company which specializes in active threat protection and network monitoring. Their services are aimed at mid-sized companies, and they have over 500 clients. The company was also in the midst of a tremendous expansion when I arrived, having doubled in size over the past year and recently opening an office in Cork, Ireland.

  I spent my summer working in the Professional Services (PS) department, working on early development for projects which would eventually become internal tools for use by eSentire at large. I worked directly with Roy Firestein, who specialized in creating the various web applications for the company which I spent the first half of the summer working on.
