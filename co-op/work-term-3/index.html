  In the summer of 2015, I was fortunate enough to work for eSentire in Cambridge, Ontario.

<h2 id="about">About eSentire</h2>
<p>
  eSentire is a cybersecurity company which specializes in active threat protection and network monitoring. Their services are aimed at mid-sized companies, and they have over 500 clients. The company was also in the midst of a tremendous expansion when I arrived, having doubled in size over the past year and recently opening an office in Cork, Ireland.
</p>

<h2 id="work">My Work</h2>
<p>
  I spent my summer working in the Professional Services (PS) department, working on early development for projects which would eventually become internal tools for use by eSentire at large. I worked directly with Roy Firestein, who specialized in creating the various web applications for the company which I spent the first half of the summer working on.

<h2 id="goals">Learning Goals</h2>
<p>At the beginning of each work term, we set learning goals outlining what we'd like to accomplish over the course of the year. This summer, my learning goals were the most clearly laid out they've ever been, and I feel like I had the greatest success this year that I've ever had. Here are my learning goals and reflections for the semester:
<ol>
  <li>
    <h3>Goal 1: Learn how to use the cloud to deploy web applications</h3>
    <p>
      The cloud is quickly taking over the web, with technologies increasingly relying on cloud computing for huge processing power and storage of big data. Talk to anyone in the industry, and they will most likely tell you that cloud computing is the future of computing (even if that may be an overstatement, I don't think anybody would deny that it's the direction the industry is heading towards). With this in mind, my first goal was to deploy a web application to the cloud. This was the first goal that Roy helped me tackle, as we deployed one of our web tools over Amazon Web Services (AWS). He explained the advantages of different database options were, and how AWS can allocate extra processing power to tasks on the fly, on an as-needed basis. I feel confident that I could now deploy a service on the cloud if I needed to.

    <h3>Goal 2: Learn web and computer security practices</h3>
    <p>
      This one explains itself. Naturally, working in a computer security company, you are taught the practices of the industry. While what I was involved with didn't give me an opportunity to directly apply computer security practices, I was able to discuss practices with coworkers and learn about different security tools, as well as threats and exploit kits seen out in the wild.
    </p>
  </li>

    <h3>Goal 3: Become experienced using Git</h3>
    <p>
      In the past I've used Git, Subversion and Mercurial for source control, but I've never felt particularly adept with them until this summer. I used Git extensively for the projects I worked on, and was able to increase my expertise with Git's most basic functions. Building on those basic functions, Roy also shared with me some resources which outlined a Git branching model used by the company, which taught me more about the high-level use of the software in practice. I feel confident now managing large projects with Git, sharing with several collaborators with many branches.
    </p>
  </li>

    <h3>Goal 4: Learn 'Pythonic' Python programming</h3>
    <p>
      The first time you learn Python, chances are you'll be heading to a website like Stack Overflow once in a while. Inevitably as you peruse Stack Overflow answers to whatever question you need answered, you'll run into some Python code that will surprise you. You'll then discover that this is called 'Pythonic' programming, where the most common or intuitive way of performing a function is often done in a very different way in Python. It may use a different control structure that you're unfamiliar with, or it may include some sort of deferred function. As I was working with Django for the first half of the semester I took it upon myself to learn how to code Python in its own, native language. by the end of the semester I had picked up many of Python's nuances, and what I learned in the process carried over to learning other technologies, like Ruby.
