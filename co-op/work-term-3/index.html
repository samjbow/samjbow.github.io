  I spent the summer of 2015 at eSentire Inc. in Cambridge, Ontario. Over the summer I was tasked with various programming tasks - I wrote JavaScript, Python, HTML and CSS, learned new technologies like Babel (and the new JavaScript standard), Django, Angular.js and Bootstrap. Perhaps most of all, I was tasked with making a Google Chrome extension, which is now being offered as an open-source project by eSentire - more on that later. Now the summer has come to a close, and it's that time again to report on my time with the company, and what I've learned and accomplished while working at eSentire.

<h2 id="about">About eSentire</h2>
<p>
  eSentire is a cybersecurity company which specializes in active threat protection, network monitoring and other security-related services. Their services are aimed at mid-sized companies, having over 500 clients at the time of writing. The company was also in the midst of a tremendous growth when I arrived, having doubled in size over the past year and recently opening an office in Cork, Ireland. They were founded in 2001 by Eldon Sprickerhoff, and they continue to expand, hiring more employees and bringing in new clients every day.

<h2 id="work">My Work</h2>
<p>
  I spent my summer with the Professional Services (PS) department, developing projects which would later become internal tools for use by eSentire at large. I worked directly with Roy Firestein, who over the course of the semester taught me how to develop web applications with Django. Roy was also responsible for helping me achieve my <a href="#goals">learning goals</a>, which you can read about below.
</p>
<p>
  For the first two months, my primary tasks included adding features and performing tweaks and fixes to our internal tools. This would teach me a great deal about Django development, as well as Python and Javascript programming, something I had only dabbled with previously.
</p>
<p>
  The most exciting part of the work term, however, would come during the last two months. I was tasked with creating a Google Chrome extension which would use data from our opensource threat aggregator <a href="https://cymon.io/" target="_blank">Cymon</a> to block web requests going out to malicious websites (the intent was 'an Adblock for malware'). The entire process was a continuous learning experience, resulting in constant code refactoring as I was always learning better practices, and more efficient ways of doing things. The extension uses the Google Chrome API to perform request blocking and redirection. Front-end components are developed in Angular.js, and back-end components are written in ECMAScript 6 and transpiled using <a href="https://babeljs.io" target="_blank">Babel</a>, <a href="http://browserify.org/">Browserify</a> and other tools. <a href="https://github.com/eSentire/cymon-interceptor" target="_blank">Cymon Interceptor is now an open source project by eSentire, and you can get the source code on Github!</a>
</p>

<h2 id="goals">Learning Goals</h2>
<p>At the beginning of each work term, we set learning goals outlining what we'd like to accomplish over the course of the year. This summer, my learning goals were the most clearly laid out they've ever been, and I feel like I had the greatest success this year that I've ever had. Here are my learning goals and reflections for the semester:
<ol>
  <li>
    <h3>Goal 1: Learn how to use the cloud to deploy web applications</h3>
    <p>
      The cloud is quickly taking over the web, with technologies increasingly relying on cloud computing for huge processing power and storage of big data. Talk to anyone in the industry, and they will most likely tell you that cloud computing is the future of computing (even if that may be an overstatement, I don't think anybody would deny that it's the direction the industry is heading towards). With this in mind, my first goal was to deploy a web application to the cloud. This was the first goal that Roy helped me tackle, as we deployed one of our web tools over Amazon Web Services (AWS). He explained the advantages of different database options were, and how AWS can allocate extra processing power to tasks on the fly, on an as-needed basis. I feel confident that I could now deploy a service on the cloud if I needed to.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <h3>Goal 2: Learn web and computer security practices</h3>
    <p>
      This one explains itself. Naturally, working in a computer security company, you are taught the practices of the industry. While what I was involved with didn't give me an opportunity to directly apply computer security practices, I was able to discuss practices with coworkers and learn about different security tools, as well as threats and exploit kits seen out in the wild.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <h3>Goal 3: Become experienced using Git</h3>
    <p>
      In the past I've used Git, Subversion and Mercurial for source control, but I've never felt particularly adept with them until this summer. I used Git extensively for the projects I worked on, and was able to increase my expertise with Git's most basic functions. Building on those basic functions, Roy also shared with me some resources which outlined a Git branching model used by the company, which taught me more about the high-level use of the software in practice. I feel confident now managing large projects with Git, sharing with several collaborators with many branches.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <h3>Goal 4: Learn 'Pythonic' Python programming</h3>
    <p>
      The first time you learn Python, chances are you'll be heading to a website like Stack Overflow once in a while. Inevitably as you peruse Stack Overflow answers to whatever question you need answered, you'll run into some Python code that will surprise you. You'll then discover that this is called 'Pythonic' programming, where the most common or intuitive way of performing a function is often done in a very different way in Python. It may use a different control structure that you're unfamiliar with, or it may include some sort of deferred function. As I was working with Django for the first half of the semester I took it upon myself to learn how to code Python in its own, native language. by the end of the semester I had picked up many of Python's nuances, and what I learned in the process carried over to learning other technologies, like Ruby.
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="acknowledgments">Acknowledgments</h2>
<p>
  I would like to thank all of eSentire's fantastic employees, particularly the Professional Services department for making the job possible. Most importantly I would like to thank Roy Firestein for supporting me throughout the semester, helping me accomplish my learning goals and teaching me a tremendous amount.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Thank you all so much, and I look forward to working with you again in the winter of 2016!</strong>
