title: Co-op Work Terms
---
<p>
  As a University of Guelph co-op software engineering student, I'm required to complete five co-op work terms before I graduate. These work terms give students the opportunity to learn skills that aren't taught in the classroom; at the time of writing this page, I've learned web development standards, HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and a multitude of other languages and technologies on these work terms. They also give us the opportunity to meet fantastic people, giving us the opportunity to learn skills from them that are desirable by other employers. These opportunities are invaluable, and if you'd like to learn about some of my experiences while on co-op, then follow any of the links below:
