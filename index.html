title: Revamp in Progress!

<p>
  Hi there! My name is Sam Bowman. I'm a soon-to-be Software Engineering graduate from the University of Guelph. Thanks for checking out my website. I'm currently in the process of revamping this, from a website I used to host co-op work term reports, to something more professional. I plan on making it better than ever, adding information about projects I've worked on, the various skills I have, and even a personal blog. In the meantime, this is what you'll see until I have everything in a state I'm content with.
